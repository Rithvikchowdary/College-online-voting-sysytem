<div class="art-body"><h2>Vote Meaning:</h2>Vote means to form a politician choice for or against someone or something by 
casting a ballot, raising your hand, speaking your choice aloud, etc.<br>
<br>
Voting may be a method for a gaggle, like a gathering or an electorate, so as to 
form a collective decision or express an opinion usually following discussions, 
debates or election campaigns.<br>
<br>
A majority vote may be a formal expression of a person's choice for or against 
some motion (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some ballot 
question; or for a particular candidate, selection of candidates, or party. A 
preferential vote may allow the voter and/or elected representative to cast one, 
some or many preferences. In elections, many countries use a vote, a practice to 
stop voters from being intimidated and to guard their political privacy.<br>
<br>
Voting often takes place at a polling station; it's voluntary in some countries, 
compulsory in others, like Australia.<br>
<br>
<h2>Election commission:</h2>The committee of India (ECI) is an autonomous and permanent constitutional body 
liable for organising free and fair elections within the Union and States of 
India. The committee operates under the authority of the Constitution per 
Article 324 and subsequently enacted the Representation of the People Act.<br>
<br>
The 
body administers elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, state Legislative 
Assemblies, state legislative councils, and therefore the offices of the 
President and vice chairman of the country. The ECI doesn't affect the elections 
to the urban bodies like Municipalities and Panchayats within the states. The 
State committee deals with the function of conducting free, fair and impartial 
elections to the local bodies within the state.<br>
<br>
<h2>Composition of committee:</h2><h3>Article 324 of the Constitution has made the subsequent provisions with 
reference to the composition of the election commission:</h3><ul>
	<li>The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and other 
	election commissioners.</li>
	<li>When the other EC is so appointed, the CEC acts because the Election 
Commission's Chairman.</li>
	<li>The President also can appoint regional commissioners to help the 
	Commission, if necessary, after consulting with the committee.</li>
	<li>The tenure of office and therefore the conditions of service of all the 
	commissioners shall be determined by the country's President.</li>
	<li>Chief Electoral Officer (CEO): Each state to possess a CEO nominated or 
	designated by the ECI in consultation with the government to supervise the 
election add the State/ UTs.</li>
	<li>District Election Officer (DEO): The ECI also nominates or designates a 
politician of the state because the District Election Officer (DEO) in 
consultation with the government. The DEO works under the general 
superintendence and control of the CEO.</li>
	<li>Electoral Registration Officer (ERO): The ERO is liable for the preparation 
of the electoral roll for every constituency (parliamentary/assembly). An appeal 
against the order of the ERO during the update of the electoral rolls now lies 
with District Magistrate.</li>
	<li>Returning Officer (RO): RO is liable for the conduct of the election 
	during a constituency and returns an elected candidate. The ECI nominates or designates a 
politician of the govt or agency because the RO in consultation with the 
government.</li>
	<li>Power to form rules under the act is conferred to the Central 
	government, which may exercise this power in consultation with the ECI.</li>
</ul>
The Civil Courts have also been barred to question the legality of any action of 
the ERO regarding revision of electoral rolls.<br>
<br>
<h2>Right to Vote:</h2>Voting is one among the foremost impactful belongings you can do for yourself 
and your community. On a macro level, it is easy to think that you're only one 
person which your vote doesn't make much of a difference. But consistent with 
Rachael Cobb, PhD, chair and professor of state at Suffolk University, your vote 
always matters.<br>
<br>
&quot;<b>Some elections are razor-thin. In 2016, the margin of victory for Donald Trump 
within the swing states that he won was but 1 percent,</b>&quot; says Dr. Cobb.<br>
<br>
Simply put, voting is power, says Dr. Cobb. &quot;The theory of democracy is that 
it's a government for and by the people, and therefore the vote is that the 
basic building block that provides people the facility to regulate their 
government and to shape what policies they need and the future direction of 
their town, state, and country,&quot; she says, adding that your vote should function 
&quot;the great equalizer.&quot; But that's not always the case.<br>
 <br>
<h2>Who can vote in India?</h2>Our Indian Constitution has particularly laid certain qualifications to become 
eligible for voting in India.
<ul>
	<li>One must be a Citizen of India;</li>
	<li>One must be above 18 years of age;</li>
	<li>Must be of sound mind.</li>
</ul>

 <br>
<b>If one becomes eligible for voting in India, then the person can participate 
within the following sorts of elections held in our country:</b>
<ul>
	<li>National-level elections;</li>
	<li>State-level elections;</li>
	<li>Local government body elections;</li>
	<li>District level elections.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>As per the voting rules:</b>
<ul>
	<li>You can cast just one vote.</li>
	<li>You must have Voter ID or EPIC card or photo identity election card.</li>
	<li>You can vote only at your registered constituency.</li>
</ul>
In 2010, voting rights were extended to citizens of India living abroad.<br>
<br>
<h2>How can you vote?</h2> <h3>The two methods the way to cast your vote, are mentioned below:</h3><ol>
	<li>Visiting the booth: By visiting the pooling booth, one can cast his 
	choose the election. this may clarify no fake vote has been sew that 
	person's behalf.</li>
	<li>Using the postal ballot: This vote is by via Post. This facility is 
	obtainable particularly to those people that cannot attend the booth 
	themselves thanks to some unavoidable circumstance; for instance, the 
	soldiers' personnel, electoral officers on duty, policemen who are on duty, 
	people on preventive detention, etc.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Process of Elections in India:</h2><ol>
	<li><b>Marking of constituencies elections:</b><br>
	Constituencies are areas marked for people to elect their representatives 
	from. In India, each constituency has roughly an identical size of the 
	population, meaning the amount officiaries from 
state to state. This also implies that the amount of seats (example, in Lok 
Sabha) is in proportion to the population of the state.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Preparation of Electoral Rolls Elections:</b><br>
	The constituencies have people that vote for his or her representatives or 
	can even represent elections themselves. Electoral rolls 'are the lists of 
	voters in one constituency. In India, there's a universal franchise by law. 
	Meaning, that each individual, above the age of 18 features a right to vote 
	and choose his representative. then all their names should appear in their 
	respective electoral rolls.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Registration of Political Parties:</b><br>
	India allows every eligible person to face for elections, as long as they 
	need a 'ticket'. A party registers for elections and individuals file their 
	nomination papers too. Then, an individual each gets a 'ticket' from the 
	party they're representing and he can formally contest the elections. Every 
	party features a symbol that represents them, for instance BJP 
features a lotus flower.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Political Campaigning Elections:</b><br>
	Each party contesting elections features a particular ideology and set of 
	policies. they have to carry political campaigns for around fortnight so as 
	to publicize them and gather voters. Ideally, they have to try to this 
	ethically by convincing voters with good policies and plans. In India, 
	they're given a specific limit of expenditure, beyond which they can't spend 
	extra money.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Voting Day Preparations Elections:</b><br>
	Today is finally when voters vote for his or her choice of representative in 
	election booths. Earlier, people want to vote by ballot paper, but nowadays, 
	they use EVM (electronic voting machines) by 
simply pressing a button on their party symbol. The votes are them later counted 
and therefore the candidate with the bulk of the votes wins the election.</li>
</ol>

 <br>
<h2>Voting Basis:</h2> <ol type="A">
  <li><b>Decision of individuals</b><br>
The first parameter considers that for what reason or on what basis people voted 
for the candidate. Where 52% people vote on work basis and 45% People voted on 
the recognition of single man.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>If you Voted, does your choice for candidate match your parents or 
	your family member's choice?</b><br>
According to the survey conducted, 12% for peoples matches their candidate's 
choice whom they're voted 23% doesn't matched that and 65% of individuals says 
that perhaps they match maybe not. meaning 65% peoples don't discuss about the 
voting reception.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Does one know what's manifesto?</b><br>
According to survey only 54% of individuals know that what's manifesto. And 46% 
people don't realize it.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Does one know the difference between Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha?</b><br>
According to survey report 80% people don't know what's difference Lok Sabha and 
Rajya Sabha where 80% people know that.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Does one vote on the idea of polling survey of Indian news channels?</b><br>
According to survey report 66% people vote by themselves but 34 you look after 
people vote on basis of stories channel surveys.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Vote on the idea of faith</b><br>
Consistent with survey report 33% of individuals vote on basis of faith . Means 
they people vote for the candidate who belongs to their religion. Where 65% of 
individuals don't see the faith of that candidate to whom they're voting. 2% 
peoples are there who vote on the idea of faith sometimes.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Does one believe term "VOTE FOR NOTE&quot;?</b><br>
According to survey report 10% people take money for giving the vote for the 
candidate where 76% are loyal who didn't take any sort of bribe for voting.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Does one know what's NOTA?</b><br>
According to survey report 47% of individuals don't know what's NOTA whether 53% 
people know about it.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>If you recognize what's NOTA. have you ever used it yet in any of the 
elections?</b><br>
According to survey report 53% people knows about NOTA but only 14% of 
individuals use it and 86% people vote for the candidate they need. </li>
</ol>
<br>
As studies of aggregate data reveal, in spite of the decreasing importance of 
the effect of urbanization, the extent of electoral participation has been 
increasing with socio-economic development. Such a pattern of increase is in 
line with the actual socio-political situation of every State. Some studies 
supported the survey of people show the essential faith of the electorate within 
the election system. Thus, the increasing electorate reflects confidence in 
electoral politics.<br>
<br>
It are often said that, though there are several defects, 
the electorate has fundamental faith within the voting system. it's important 
that such fundamental faith within the core of the democratic regime, namely the 
election system, has been maintained for five decades, despite several political 
crises. because the popularity of the once dominant Congress party has gradually 
decreased, the peculiar pattern of party preference of every State in line with 
the actual socio-political situation, especially castes religions, backwardness, 
et al., has come to the surface.<br>
<br>
As a result, there has been a transparent 
differentiation of the party system since the 1980's, and therefore the era of 
multi-party systems and coalition governments has come. Many parties have grown 
supported particular ethnic groups like castes and religion. But such increase 
and strengthening of regional parties supported some particular ethnos has not 
necessarily exposed the matter of national integration due to the aforementioned 
basic faith within the democratic regime.<br>
<br>
Many ethnicity-based parties also are likely to be patronage-based parties. 
during a very heterogeneous country like India, a celebration could also be 
supported some specific ethnic groups, but it also must articulate and integrate 
other ethnicities so as to grow. so as to articulate and integrate other 
ethnicities, one effective strategy is to require moderate policy and distribute 
patronage or interests to other ethnic groups. Conversely, if an ethnicity-based 
party takes a radical and disintegrative policy with no patronage to be 
distributed, it cannot attract the support of other ethnicities.<br>
<br>
<h3>Thus, the 
electoral process during a heterogeneous country has two effects on the party 
system:</h3><ol>
	<li>differentiation on the idea of a specific ethnic also as a 
	socio-economic situation and</li>
	<li>an integrative effect.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Problems faced by people casting vote Challenges in India:</h3> <b>In India, there are a few of problems that substitute the way of free and fair 
elections. a number of these are:</b><br>
The rigging of poll booths: Some big political parties have a clear advantage 
where they will use a more than money power to 'buy' votes with bribery. Even 
while campaigning, smaller parties have a disadvantage since they don't have the 
maximum amount money or power because the bigger parties.<br>
<br>
Populism is additionally a serious problem in India:  Parties in India follow 
caste politics where parties give the 'ticket' to an individual who is from a 
scheduled caste in order that in his/ her constituency, he's bound to win.<br>
<br>
This entrenches power in just one caste and at an equivalent time violates the 
sacred purpose of reservations.<br>
<br>
<h2>Awareness of voting rights:</h2>It has become a standard ritual to speak bitter about any candidate or an 
elected leader of any legislative assembly or the parliament. The fault-finding 
then comes right down to the 'System' and the way democracy isn't working 
because it should. However, a really little room has been given to 'What the 
people can do' to strengthen the democratic roots and convey a few changes 
within the system. even as it is the responsibility of the elected leader to 
fulfil the well-beings of the voters, an equivalent is that the need for the 
people of India to contribute to picking the right leader for his or her 
representation.<br>
<br>
Democracy has given people a strong right- that's to VOTE. 
Voting is that the fundamental basis of democracy's 'Of the people, for the 
people, and by the people' slogan. Therefore, instead of enjoying it as a 
vacation, one must vote if he truly wants to contribute to the nation-building 
process and bring a few changes. A Citizen should actually not got to find any 
reason to Vote. It must be done as a compulsive duty although there's no legal 
obligation to vote.<br>
<br>
<h3>Here are some points which might aid in enlightening voters about the importance 
of Voting:</h3>Every Single Vote Is Significant: Needless to mention, every citizen's vote is 
counted within the polling process. If the people are equally divided between 
two candidates, one single vote are often a game-changer and a clincher. we've 
seen within the past how one vote from an MP can decide the autumn of the 
government. precisely the same way, one person's vote can confirm the win/fall 
of an aspiring MP or MLA.<br>
<br>
Origin of the Change: Aside from the protests, voting may be a highly effective 
medium to possess the change that we would like within the government. Our 
nation has already witnessed how a non-performing government gets dethroned by 
the spirit of wanting a change. In recent years, there's a considerable rise 
within the voting percentage and other people are truly loving to be the 'Change 
Makers'.<br>
<br>
<h3>Isn't it exciting that an individual can choose the leader of the 
country right from the age of 18?</h3>Non-choosers get NOTA: Sometimes, it's possible that one doesn't want any single 
candidate to be elected from all who are contesting. The committee has made a 
special provision of NOTA. It stands for None of The Above. Hence if none of the 
candidates fit into your criteria, just hit the NOTA option and voice the 
opinion. Introduction of this alternative is believed to play a big role within 
the future. within the late future, it's going to even be possible that the NOTA 
will decide the re-elections with fresh candidates.<br>
<br>
A Sense of Pride: We must honour the proper of voting given by the constitution 
of India. The youngsters are well excited to exercise their right to vote as 
soon as they turn 18. the sensation after having cast a vote infuses a way of 
pride for being a responsible citizen. As are often witnessed from the sharing 
of the inked finger on social media. The trend is constant to realize popularity 
amongst the youngers and therefore the elders also.<br>
<br>
Gone are the times when it had been required for people to motivate them to 
vote. The vote share for the General Election of 2014 was 8% above the previous 
election. vote within the Lok Sabha Election 2019 was 67%. Voter awareness 
program has become successful in its mission and therefore the vote share 
continues to extend till date in many state elections. With this increasing 
number of voter turnout, we'll soon reach the 80-90% golden mark.<br>
 <br>
<h2>Voting rights of prisoners:</h2>When around 90 crore Indian citizens (Economic Times 2019) were set to choose 
the 2019 Lok Sabha
elections, approximately four lakh Indian citizens weren't given an opportunity 
to vote.<br>
<br>
These citizens are prisoners, denied their right to franchise supported 
Section 62(5) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951:
<ul>
	<li>No person shall vote at any election if he's confined during a prison, whether 
under a sentence of
imprisonment or transportation or otherwise, or is within the lawful custody of 
the police: as long as
nothing during this sub-section shall apply to an individual subjected to 
preventive detention under any law for the nonce effective.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>India, which is usually mentioned because the world's "largest democracy," has 
been denying the foremost fundamental right of suffrage to its four lakh 
eligible voters. India is one among the only a few countries to have a blanket 
ban on all prisoners. Such a ban affects detainees, undertrials and convicts 
alike. Only those who are out on bail can vote (Election Commission of India 
2019).</li>
</ul>
This issue has not been discussed too often within the last 70 years. In 1997, 
the Supreme Court of India
(SC) (AIR 1997 SC 2814) while rejecting the petition seeking the proper to vote 
for prisoners provided
some reasons for why such a ban was in place:<br>
<ol type="i">
  <li>Resource crunch as permitting everyone in prison also to vote would 
	require deployment of a much larger police and greater security 
	arrangements.</li>
	<li>An individual who is in prison as a result of his own conduct cannot 
	claim equal freedom.</li>
	<li>To stay persons with criminal background far away from the election 
	scene.</li>
</ol><br>
However, many of our legislators, ironically, have criminal cases registered 
against them (Beniwal and Kumaresan 2019). In 2018, a nation-wide strike was 
organized by prisoners within the us (US), and one among their demands was 
they're given the proper to vote (IWOC 2018).<br>
<br>
"The voting rights of all confined 
citizens serving prison sentences, pretrial detainees, then called 'ex-felons' 
must be counted. Representation is demanded. All voices count." one among the 
prisoners was quoted saying: "I will pay taxes but I won't be ready to vote�It 
lets me know that I'm not truly a citizen ... I will be able to haven't any say 
within the political process or the direction of the nation" (Pilkington 2018).<br>
<br>
In April 2019 in India, three law students filed a public interest litigation (PIL) 
within the SC, seeking right to vote for the prisoners and an amendment to the 
Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. While this case will take its course within 
the coming months, it's important for us to reimagine the longer term of the 
criminal justice system in our country.<br>
<br>
Can we need a retributive system, where 
citizens are condemned and forgotten, or should we aim for a reformative system 
which aims to enhance the structure of society, nurturing the law-breakers and 
integrate them back to the society? Right to vote for prisoners is one step 
towards shaping our criminal justice system into a caring, and reform-oriented 
institution, one that abides by the universally accepted human rights values.<br>

<h2>Problems faced by parties:</h2><ul>
	<li>What are the varied challenges faced by political parties?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>There are many challenges faced by Political parties which are explained below:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Lack of internal democracy within parties is that the first challenge.</li>
	<li>Across the world, one can see that there's a growing concentration of power 
within the hands of few or just one leader. On what transpires inside the party, 
ordinary members of the party don't get sufficient information. Ordinary members 
are unable to influence decisions as they lack sufficient connections.</li>
	<li>Decisions are taken within the name of the party, by leaders having more power.</li>
	<li>Parties don't conduct internal regular elections; organizational meetings aren't 
conducted and don't
maintain a register of the membership.</li>
	<li>Since an excessive amount of power is wielded by few leaders within the party, 
those that afflict the
leadership are unable to continue working within the party.</li>
	<li>Personal loyalty to the leader becomes more important than the loyalty to party 
policies and
principles. Due to the system of succession thanks to dynasty within the 
political parties, ordinary and hardworking party members are unable to rise to 
the highest.</li>
	<li>A transparent and an open system of functioning isn't followed by political 
parties, which prevents deserving party members from rising to the highest.</li>
	<li>Relatives or people on the brink of the leaders of the party are given favours 
which are unfair to other party workers. Members of only one family hold 
complete control in many parties. this is often not fair to other members of 
that party. Hence people that don't have popular support or adequate experience 
get the positions of power which is unhealthy for a democracy.</li>
	<li>The third challenge is during elections there's a rising role of muscle power 
and money power in political parties. Candidates who can raise money or those 
that have money are usually nominated by the Political Parties. Political 
parties have supported many criminals for contesting elections.</li>
	<li>Short-cuts are wont to win elections since parties' sole focus is on 
	winning elections</li>
	<li>Decisions and policies of the political parties are usually influenced by 
organisations or rich people who give funds to the party. Across the planet, 
thanks to a decline within the ideological differences among political parties, 
there's no significant difference, thereby reducing option to the voters.</li>
	<li>Not giving meaningful option to the voters is that the fourth challenge that's 
often faced by political parties. Election law bill: After independence, there 
was a requirement to carry general elections to elect a very representative 
government on the idea of universal adult suffrage. Article 325 of the 
constitution ensures universal suffrage and provides that nobody be ineligible 
for inclusion in, or to say to be included during a special, electoral roll-on 
grounds of faith, race, caste or sex.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Universal Adult Suffrage:</h2>Universal adult suffrage is that the right to vote of 
all adult citizens, regardless of wealth, income, gender, social station, race, 
or ethnicity, subject only to minor exceptions. The ECI as an independent 
constitutional authority was therefore brought into force from November 26th, 
1949. to supply a legal framework for the conduct of elections, Parliament 
passed the Representation of the People Act, 1950, Representation of the People 
Act, 1951 and Delimitation Commission Act of 2002.<br>
 <br>
<h2>Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1950:</h2> <b>Key Provisions:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Lays down procedures for delimitation of constituencies.</li>
	<li>Provides for the allocation of seats within the House of the People and 
	within the Legislative</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Assemblies and Legislative Councils of States.</h2><ul>
	<li>Lays procedure for the preparation of electoral rolls and therefore the 
	manner of filling seats.</li>
	<li>Lays down the qualification of voters.</li>
	<li>The President of India has been conferred the facility to amend orders 
	delimiting constituencies, only after consulting the ECI.</li>
	<li>In Lok Sabha, there's a reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and 
Scheduled Tribes.</li>
	<li>The ECI has the facility to work out the constituencies to be reserved for 
scheduled tribes within the states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura</li>
	<li>Under Article 82 of the Constitution, the Parliament by law enacts a 
	Delimitation Act after every census.</li>
	<li>After coming into force, the commencement of the Act, the Central 
	Government constitutes a Delimitation Commission. This Delimitation 
	Commission demarcates the boundaries of the Parliamentary Constituencies as 
	per provisions of the Delimitation Act.</li>
	<li>The present delimitation of constituencies has been done on the idea of 
	the 2001 census figures under the provisions of Delimitation Act, 2002.</li>
	<li>Notwithstanding the above, the Constitution of India was specifically 
	amended in 2002 to not have delimitation of constituencies till the primary 
	census after 2026. </li>
	<li>Thus, this Constituencies carved out on the idea of the 2001 census 
	shall still be operational till the primary census after 2026.</li>
	<li>As far as possible, every state gets representation within the Lok Sabha in 
proportion to its population as per census figures.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>The Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951:</h2><ul>
	<li>It regulates the particular conduct of elections and by-elections.</li>
	<li>It provides administrative machinery for conducting elections.</li>
	<li>It deals with the registration of political parties.</li>
	<li>It specifies the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of 
	the homes.</li>
	<li>It provides provisions to curb corrupt practices and other offences.</li>
	<li>It lays down the procedure for settling doubts and disputes arising out 
	of elections.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Qualification for Contesting Elections in India:</h2><h3>The Parliament has laid down the subsequent qualifications (for contesting 
election) within the RPA, 1951:</h3><ul>
	<li>An individual must be an elector within the constituency.</li>
	<li>The person must be a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in 
	any state/UTs if
he/she wants to contest a seat reserved for them.</li>
	<li>The minimum age for becoming an MLA/MPs (Lok Sabha) is 25 years.</li>
	<li>At the panchayat and municipality levels, the minimum regulation for 
contesting elections is 21 years.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Right to Vote:</h2>Apart from Article 326 of the Constitution (that guarantees the proper to 
vote to each citizen above the age of 18 years, unless disqualified by any law), 
Section 62 of the RPA,1951 also ensures that each person who is within 
the electoral roll of that constituency is entitled to vote.<br>
<br>
One person can vote at one constituency only and just for just one 
occasion during a particular election. If an individual is confined during 
a prison, whether under a sentence of imprisonment or transportation, then he is 
not eligible for voting, however, within the case of preventive custody, he can 
vote. In 2014, the ECI had said that the person under preventive custody had the 
proper to vote, but not under-trials and convicts.<br>
<br>
However, the Act allows those serving sentences but 2 years to contest elections 
from prison.<br>
<br>
(NOTA) None of the Above was introduced within the ballot papers/ 
Electronic mechanical device (EVMs) in General Election to the State Assemblies 
in 2013.<br>
<br>
VVPAT: Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail is an independent system attached with 
the EVMs that allows voters to verify that their votes are cast as intended. it 
had been introduced in 2013, after the SC allowed the ECI for the 'requirement 
of free and fair elections' in its verdict within the People's Union for Civil 
Liberties vs. Union of India case (2013).<br>
<br>
<h2>Provisions associated with Political Parties:</h2><ul>
	<li>Every association or body so as to become a political party must be 
	registered with the ECI whose decision regarding registration are going to 
be final.</li>
	<li>Registered political parties, in course of your time, can get 
	recognition as 'State Party' or National Party'.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Change in name only and address of a registered party must be 
	communicated to the ECI.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>The ECI cannot derecognize a celebration</h2><ul>
	<li>Voluntary contributions by a person or company within India ( aside from 
	a government company) can be accepted by the registered party</li>
	<li>A company can donate any amount of cash to any party.</li>
	<li>There is no obligation of the corporate to report such donations in its 
	profit and loss account.</li>
	<li>It is mandatory for the political parties to undergo the ECI an inventory of 
donations they received above Rs. 2,000</li>
	<li>Political parties cannot receive quite Rs 2000 as cash donations.</li>
	<li>Now, political parties are eligible to simply accept contributions from 
	foreign companies defined under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 
	2010.</li>
	<li>Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Individuals contesting elections 
	need to file an affidavit, declaring their criminal records, assets &amp; 
	liabilities and academic qualification</li>
	<li>After getting elected, MPs are required to file a declaration of assets 
	and liabilities with the Speaker of Lok Sabha and therefore the Chairman of Rajya 
Sabha.</li>
	<li>These declarations need to be made by MPs within 90 days of taking their 
	seats in Parliament.</li>
</ul>

 <br>
<h2>Right to Information:</h2>Candidates got to furnish information whether he/she is accused of any offence 
punishable with imprisonment of two years or more during a pending case or has 
been convicted of an offence.<br>
<br>
<h2>Voting Through Postal Ballot:</h2><ul>
	<li>Any class of person are often notified by the ECI in consultation with 
	the concerned government which can give their votes by postal ballot</li>
	<li>Section 126 of the RPA, 1951prohibits displaying any election matter by 
means, inter alia, of
television or similar apparatus, during the amount of 48 hours before the hour 
fixed for conclusion of poll during a constituency.</li>
	<li>Violation of the provisions of Section 126 is punishable with 
	imprisonment upto a period of two years, or with fine or both.</li>
	<li>Section 126A prohibits the conduct of poll and dissemination of its 
	results during the amount mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Ceiling on Expenditure:</h2>A candidate contesting polls in large states can spend up to Rs 70 lakh within 
the Lok Sabha election and Rs 28 lakh in an Assembly election.<br>
<br>
<h2>Counting of Votes:</h2>At every election where a poll is taken, the votes are counted by, or under the supervision of the
Returning Officer (RO), and contesting candidate, his election agent and his counting agents.
Destruction, loss, damage or tampering of ballot papers at the time of counting must be reported by
the RO to the ECI.<br>
<br>
<h2>Corrupt Practices:</h2>All government or non-government officials are included within the scope of 
corrupt practices.<br>
<br>
<h2>Promoting Enmity:</h2>Any person who promotes or attempts to market on grounds of faith, race, caste, 
community or
language, feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of 
India are often punished with imprisonment for a term which can reach 3 years.<br>
<br>
Prohibition of public meetings during a period of 48 hours ending with the hour 
fixed for the
conclusion of the poll.<br>
<br>
<h2>Disqualification of MPs and MLAs:</h2>The RPA, 1951 lays down certain rules for disqualification of MPs and MLAs.
<ul>
	<li>Section 8 (3) of the Act states that if an MP or MLA is convicted for 
	the other crime and is
sent to jail for two years or more, he/ she is going to be disqualified for 
six years from the time of release.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Albeit an individual is on bail after the conviction and his appeal is 
	pending for disposal, he is
disqualified from contesting an election.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Section 8(4) allowed convicted MPs, MLAs and MLCs to continue in their posts, 
provided
they appealed against their conviction/sentence in higher courts within 3 months 
of the date of judgment by the court.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Supreme Court in July 2013 struck down section 8(4) of the RPA, 1951 and declared it
ultra vires and held that the disqualification takes place from the date of 
	conviction. Challenges;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>False Disclosures:</b><br>
	Even after the supply of the declaration of assets and 
liabilities within the RPA act, candidates don't disclose all the assets and 
supply wrong and incomplete information regarding their assets, liabilities, and 
income and academic qualifications.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>The Bureaucratization of Politics:</b><br>
	In spite of the inclusion of several 
provisions aimed toward making the ECI as an independent body, it's still hooked 
in to the Union for financial matters that paves the way for political parties 
to manage to urge the officers in their favour through money and muscle power.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Dual Responsibility of the ECI:</b><br>
	The ECI doesn't have independent staff of its 
own so whenever elections happen, it's to depend on staff of Central and State 
Governments hence the twin responsibility of the executive staff, to the 
govt for ordinary administration and to the ECI
for electoral administration isn't conducive to the impartial and efficient 
functioning of the
Commission.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Misuse of state Machinery:</b><br>
	The RPAs lack clear provisions and guidelines on 
the matters
related to the misuse of official machinery that provides an unfair advantage to 
the ruling party at the time of elections and results in the misuse of public 
funds for furthering the prospects of candidates of a particular party. The 
misuse of official machinery takes different forms, like the difficulty of 
advertisements at the value of government and public exchequer highlighting 
their achievements, disbursements out of the discretionary funds at the disposal 
of the ministers, use of state vehicles for canvassing etc.</li>
</ul>

 <br>
<b>Amendments:</b><br>
<h3>Linking electoral roll data with Aadhaar:</h3>
The 1950 Act provides that an 
individual may apply to the electoral registration officer for inclusion of 
their name within the electoral roll of a constituency. After verification, if 
the officer is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to registration, he will 
direct the applicant's name to be included within the electoral roll. The Bill 
adds that the electoral registration officer may require an individual to 
furnish their Aadhaar
number for establishing their identity.<br>
<br>
If their name is already within 
the electoral roll, then the Aadhaar number may be required for authentication 
of entries within the roll. Persons won't be denied inclusion within 
the electoral roll or have
their names deleted from the roll, if they're unable to furnish Aadhaar 
number thanks to sufficient cause as prescribed. Such persons could also 
be permitted to furnish alternate documents prescribed by the central 
government.<br>
<br>
<h3>Qualifying date for enrolment in electoral roll:</h3>Under the 1950 Act, the 
qualifying date for enrolment within the electoral roll is January 1 of the 
year during which such roll is being prepared or revised. this suggests that an 
individual
who turns 18 (i.e., eligible to vote) after January 1 can enroll within 
the electoral roll only the roll is prepared/ revised subsequent year. The Bill 
amends this to supply four qualifying dates during a civil year, which can be 
January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1.<br>
<br>
<h3>Requisitioning of premises for election purposes:</h3>The 1951 Act permits 
the government to requisition
premises needed or likely to be needed for getting used as polling stations, or 
for storing ballot boxes after a poll has<br>
been conducted. The Bill expands the needs that such premises are 
often requisitioned. These include using the premises for counting, storage of 
voting machines and poll-related material, and accommodation of security forces 
and polling personnel.<br>
<br>
<h3>Gender-neutral provisions:</h3>The 1950 Act permits certain persons who are 
ordinarily resident during a constituency to register in electoral rolls. Such 
persons include those holding a service qualification, like members of the armed 
forces or central government employees posted outside India. The wives of such 
persons also are deemed to be ordinarily residing within the same constituency 
if they reside with them. The 1951 Act enables the wife of a
person holding a service qualification to vote either face to face or by postal 
ballot. The Bill replaces the term 'wife' with 'spouse' in both the Acts.<br>
 <br>
<b>Criticism:</b><br>
Over 23 organizations and 500 individuals have flayed the move to link Aadhaar 
with voter ID and have written to the committee of India (ECI) to withdraw the 
proposal.<br>
A month ago, the ECI had said that the move would help comb out duplicate or 
maybe non-existent voters. the govt had approached the Unique Identification 
Authority of India (UIDAI) with the proposal to allow the ECI to use Aadhaar for 
registration of latest voters.<br>
<br>
While sources at the ECI have confirmed that the proposal was still into 
account , those critical
of the move said that it might create mass disenfranchisement, increase voter 
fraud and need the proposal to be withdrawn.<br>
<br>
One of the signatories, Srinivas K, told TOI that using Aadhaar for <b>cleaning 
up</b> databases of other government registries, like MGNREGA and PDS, have led to 
arbitrary deletion of names of citizens from the system with none notice.<br>
<br>
In the letter, a replica of which is with the TOI, they need stated that the 
move could  fundamentally alter the structure of democracy, undermine electoral 
democracy and impact voters' trust within the electoral system.<br>
<br>
The letter further noted that the Election Commission's proposal would violate 
the judgment of the  Supreme Court within the Puttaswamy case, which limited the 
utilization of Aadhaar authentication solely to welfare programmes.<br>
<br>
The letter further elaborated that in 2018, election officials from Telangana 
and Andhra Pradesh linked Aadhaar data with voter ID cards after which 
individuals found that a minimum of 55 lakh voters had been arbitrarily 
disenfranchised.
Despite all these the legislature successfully passed the bill and is now 
implemented.<br>
